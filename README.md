This repository is an online portfolio of all class and personal projects <br>
done during my undergraduate career at Wichita State University as a <br>
Computer Science student. All graduate projects done (where acceptable) <br>
according to the institution rules for academic honesty (if permitted) <br>
will be uploaded here throughout my graduate career at Wichita State University.

## Undergraduate Research Project (put direct link here - see Autoencoder_Code_(Sriram's_data).ipynb file)
Brief Summary: This project basically deals with network traffic and how we can use both a Machine Learning algorithm <br>
and an unsupervised artificial neural network, called an autoencoder, to detect and classify benign from <br>
malicious DoH traffic.

Background: Domain Name System (DNS) is unencrypted, which shows the entire Internet browsing history for Internet Service Providers (ISP). <br>
To resolve that issue, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) was developed, which is just an enhanced version of DNS. This also isn't helpful as botnets can exploit <br>
to talk with Communication & Control center. We want to detect botnet activity that uses DoH that protects users' privacy.


Solution: In the ipynb notebook, An autoencoder recreates input given by traffic and replicates the input as the output. <br>
The autoencoder is trained to recreate benign and malicious traffic and we obtain 3D visualizations, called embeddings. <br>
Then, I implement a K-means clustering algorithm to find clusters of benign & malicious traffic in 3D space. The classification percentages of <br>
91.38% precision, 89.31% accuracy, 87.10% recall, and 89.19% f-score.

# Class and Personal Projects Repository

This repository is an online portfolio of all class and personal projects <br>
done during my undergraduate career at Wichita State University as a <br>
Computer Science student. All graduate projects done (where acceptable) <br>
according to the institution rules for academic honesty (if permitted) <br>
will be uploaded here throughout my graduate career at Wichita State University.

## Undergraduate Research Project (put direct link here - see Autoencoder_Code_(Sriram's_data).ipynb file)
This project basically deals with network traffic and how we can use both a Machine Learning algorithm <br>
and an unsupervised artificial neural network, called an autoencoder, to detect and classify legitimate from <br>
benign DoH traffic.
